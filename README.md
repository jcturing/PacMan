# PacMan
This was my very first programming project, it was made within a college buddy [Edu](https://github.com/tito-kimbo)

## Description
It is fully programmed in **C++** and using **BoolEngine**, which is a very simple Game Engine I created before this game.
It provides a AI for the ghost, encryption system for the game progress and a level map editor, _this way you can create your own maps_.
The main GUI is simple and is probably not really efficient, it was my first contact with a game GUI and I made it with my first ideas.

## Playing
You can freely play it and test it downloading and executing the .exe in the game folder. Help is welcome and pull requests will be checked.
